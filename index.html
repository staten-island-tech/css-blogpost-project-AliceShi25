          The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue
          eyes. Its literally so pretty omg. The most gorgeous breed of cat like
          ever. If there was a girl as pretty as a ragdoll and she was in front
          of me, I'd ask her to step on me.

          The Himalayan (short for Himalayan Persian, or Colourpoint Persian as
          it is commonly referred to in Europe), is a breed or sub-breed of
          long-haired cat similar in type to the Persian, I have a type and it's
          Persian cat type pretty. The Himalayan cats, especially those with
          blue eyes are so gorgeous. If goddesses were cats, it'd be the
          Himalayans.

          The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional
          British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, dense coat,
          and broad face. They're so cute??? Literally adorable. If my younger
          brothers were as cute as them I'd like them much better.
